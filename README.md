# Steppeaway

An open-source web application designed for tourists to optimally plan travel between desired locations, and the modes of travel between those locations. The name comes from "steppe" which is a grassland plain found all aover the world, and "away" which indicates getting "away" from familiarity and exploring new places. We are only Steppeaway from planning our dream vacation locations. This was built with functionality and help provided by the Google Maps API and its documentation.

## Work in Progress
This application is unfinished and is currently being worked on. The code has yet to be optimized in terms of perforamnce, lines of code, software depencies, and paradigm use. Steppesaway is not an official application and does not include all of the features it hopes to provide upon completion. Additionally it mostly uses imperative programming as opposed to declarative programming. This application has intentions of running declaratively for future uses in order to minimize code and perform with a stronger control flow, rather than using step-by-step code segments.

The primary colors of the application are blue and white, representing colors used by Google, because the application is built using the Google Maps API. Future colors and themes may or may not be available.

This application is not meant to replace Google Maps, but instead be used with it upon completion.

## Main Software and Dependencies
- Google Maps API
- Flask (may switch to Django)
- jQuery (may discontinue for this application)

## Video Demo Example
### Demonstrates the use of the developer's own algoirthm to solve the TSP rather than Google's. 
#### Notice the title of the webpage is called "Interactive TSP Solver" because it a solution to the Traveling Salesman Prolem. This is a working title.
